[Premium Add-ons](https://bqworks.net/premium-add-ons/#accordion-slider) allow you to further extend the functionality of the accordion slider:

* [Custom CSS and JavaScript](https://bqworks.net/premium-add-ons/#custom-css-js-for-accordion-slider): Allows you to add custom CSS and JavaScript code to your accordion sliders in a syntax highlighting code editor. It also features a revisions system that will backup all your code edits, allow you to compare between multiple revisions and restore a certain revision.
* [Revisions](https://bqworks.net/premium-add-ons/#revisions-for-accordion-slider): Automatically stores a record of each edit/update of your accordions, for comparison or backup purposes. Each accordion will have its own list of revisions, allowing you to easily preview a revision, analyze its settings, compare it to other revisions or restore it.
